The injection point is where it reads password, if we can overwrite the accessLevel in login(), and bypas all the user name in if-else clause, the function will return the overwritten value :)

When it asks for password, enter:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

(the last '.' is included)
