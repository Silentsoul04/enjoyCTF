1. play to the fourth floor, we have to pick one flag. Then, which one?

2. found those code in /server/game.js:
****************************************
case "revealFlag":
    if (entity.items[action.item].effects[i].check == 64) {
        outcome.flag = process.env["PICO_CTF_FLAG"];
    }
break;
****************************************

and analyse them with code in /server/config.js, we will figure out the row is 13 and column is 5.
