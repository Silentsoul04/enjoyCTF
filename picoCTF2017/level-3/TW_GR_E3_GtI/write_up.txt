Reading the source code, we can easily found that the point is in the function executeMove in server/game.js, especially the picking item logic.
And according to the server/config.js, we know the id of flag is 12. So we just need to find the same item with id 12, then drop it at last floor and pick it up.
The only problem is how I can know the id of a item? Because the play can only carry eight items to the next floor.
Don't forgot that the website uses socket.io and there has to be a client.js on frontend whose code is used to maintaining frontend status.
