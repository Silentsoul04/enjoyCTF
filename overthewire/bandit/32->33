in previous level's ssh
cat /etc/passwd | grep 'bandit32'
=> bandit32:x:11032:11032:bandit level 32:/home/bandit32:/home/bandit32/uppershell

so we are using this uppershell

login to bandit32, every command will be capitalized automatically.

It may be special chars in bash, like '$0', '$1' ...

Somehow $0 gives me the shell directly.

$0

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
=> c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee

googled and find these two blogs
https://www.nagekar.com/2018/08/overthewire-bandit-27-33.html
https://int3rsys.github.io/Bandit27-34/

so another solution is to create a symbol link in tmp folder and go there and execute that one.
