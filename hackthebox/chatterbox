(Love this box! Learn how to get powershell reverse shell! More convenient!)
Points:
- all port scan => achat
- find exploit and change the CMD in msfvenom command to download and execute powershell reverse tcp.
- use PowerUp.ps1 to get low hanging fruits
- classic password reuse vuln

Details:
- some payload will fail may be because of the vuln itself. => use CMD
- powershell rev => nishang/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1. And remember to add command at last. Refer the examples in comments.
