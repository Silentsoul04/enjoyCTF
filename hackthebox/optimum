(Love this box, learnt a lot for windows priv esc)
Points:
- easy web CVE to get user shell
- use windows exploit enumerators to get the suggestions.

Try the output suggested vulnerabilities. If you use MSF, remember to set right target.
Note, sometimes `show options` doesn't show all the target options. Use `show targets` and `set target` (no 's')
