(Love this box, learnt a lot for windows priv esc)
Points:
- easy web CVE to get user shell
- use windows exploit enumerators to get the suggestions.

Try the output suggested vulnerabilities. If you use MSF, remember to set right target.(msf priv esc didn't work for me anyway)
Note, sometimes `show options` doesn't show all the target options. Use `show targets` and `set target` (no 's')

Note! if you use powershell.exe, it is by default the C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe, which is just a 32bits on 64bits windows process! It cannot capture any thread handle!
use this => C:\Windows\SysNative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
(or C:\Windows\System32\..., yes, it is called 32 but has 64-bit programs)
