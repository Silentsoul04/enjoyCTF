(This box is a little strange)
Points:
- dirbuster: there is an option in dirbuster to brute force file with specific extension.
- learn information from the name of the box

Use dirbuster to find the hidden script file. Then the box name tells me there could be a very famous exploit. Find it and use it. Remember to add the discovered hidden file to the list. => use shell

Read the output of the LinEnum.sh and there is a very easy why to priv esc. Do what it says and don't try the parts separately.
