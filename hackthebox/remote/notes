source code show it is using umbraco
google how to tell umbraco version, in Web.config =>
<add key="umbracoConfigurationStatus" value="7.12.4" />
find an exploit for this version https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46153, it need auth

try to locate database connectionsStrings, it uses a Umbraco.sdf file.
<add name="umbracoDbDSN" connectionString="Data Source=|DataDirectory|\Umbraco.sdf;Flush Interval=1;" providerName="System.Data.SqlServerCe.4.0" />
it is using a microsoft SQL server compact file

find the file under App_Data, how to extract data from it?
failed, all failed, even visual studio saied it is corrupted.

read ./App_Data/Logs, find silly user who entered his password as username, via bash:
use cat grep cut sort uniq to get a list of users
=>
Admin
admin@htb.local
smith
smith@htb.local
ssmith
ssmith@htb.local
Umbracoadmin123!!

looks like the user accidentally entered the password in username. Tried crackmapexec and msf winrc_login but all failed.

go back to the sdf files and use strings to get some information. Except for the users, also find information at the begin. Find some hash.

admin@htb.local:baconandcheese
smith@htb.local: (failed, hmacsha256)
ssmith@htb.local:(failed, hmacsha256)

still get nothing.
=> after reset the machine, get in with baconandcheese

run the modified exploit, get shell.

# priv esc
google "teamviewer extract password" => tried several tools, failed.
then find this blog https://whynotsecurity.com/blog/teamviewer/

download its decrypt python script. And use following command to extract registry value.
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TeamViewer\Version7
(the registy path is also found from the blog)

use the script and decrypt the password => !R3m0te!

get root shell via psexec
