(love it. learnt a lot about fuzzing)
#Hint:
- gobuster claims some pages can be visited while in firefox they are not => Look at their request headers.
- wfuzz
- in bash, insert the '\' in front of a normal char will do nothing. But it can escape some filter.
- maybe the target is expecting a param, splited it from the input.

#New Tools
- wfuzz

#Details
- find /usr/share/seclists | grep -i param => find the dictionaries we can use
- find /usr/share/seclists | grep -i char
- the WAF filter out some patterns, not just chars and words
