(For the priv esc part, very hard to me actually, first time to know VNC)
Points:
- base64
- password reuse
- vncviewer
- ssh tunneling
- log poisoning

web => find encrypted password => decrypt it => user shell by ssh

find secret file => download to host => unzip with same password => but useless file, right now.

check netstat -an and the ps aux to see there is a service only listen to local 5801 and 5901 ports.
=> tunneling needed => ssh -D 1080 -L6801:127.0.0.1:5801 -L6901:127.0.0.1:5901 charix@10.10.10.84

The 6801 and 6901 is on the attack kali machine.

Then on kali machine => vncviewer -passwd secret 127.0.0.1::6901 => get root.

(also the intended way for the user shell is the log poisoning)
