(love this one)
Points:
- MSF local_exploit_suggester
- if msf failed to get a shell, may be it is because the server is too slow. We need burp suit to see what's going on and what we can do with the rest.
- MSF may use the wrong LHOST if you use a VPN. Pay attention to the log and set it if necessary.
- Locate the MSF module and change the timeout!
- LFI cannot be used, tested, it seems they banned it.

I learnt so much from this box.
What is the service on a strange port? Find it.
The lag in the server is on purpose. So what I learnt in PWK for the same software doesn't work.
MSF module will fail. But use burp suit, proxy, options, add a new proxy. And see what's going on in repeater.

Also there is a useful tool called unicorn, it is helpful to get meterpreter shell when you already have a user shell. But I did it manually as what I learnt in PWK.
