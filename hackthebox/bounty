(TODO, try&learn merlin)
Points:
- dirbuster => remember our target is iis, choose to brute force aspx
- we need powershell payload which go via https or http/2
- (in video, it also uses the intended tool called "merlin" which is cool and goes via http/2)
- suggester to priv esc if you use meterpreter

New Tools:
- merlin
- unicorn

Details:
- merlin: https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin, but some of its modules needs internet access.
- need to reset the machine sometimes.
- somehow the unicorn approach get stuck in my case.
