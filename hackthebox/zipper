Hint:
- what does the hidden port means?
- shell from agent is ephemeral, maybe we can talk to it from server, and ask it run commands
- linux command `nohup` and `&`
- try different commands to get reverse shell, some just don't work
- two ways to priv esc. $PATH way is not intended. Intented way is easy too.

Details:
- My alternative is to write a script to add another user and change script by using API and the credentials.
- when 'su' says 'must be run from a terminal', run "script -q /dev/null". The same is helpful for interactive case, like run mysql cli in rev shell.
