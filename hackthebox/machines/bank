Points:
- /etc/hosts
- dirbuster => be patient => find /balance-transfer/ => find user and password
- login and upload png => burp it and change content => read response html and find we should change file name to '.htb' => reverse shell
- enum and find a strange suid file => run it and done


Details:
- alternative is to change the response header from 302 to 200, we can still request for that page. And we can find surprise. 
- after you get the user, read .php files and get the mysql credential. But they are not very useful here.
- alternative priv sec is to change /etc/passwd. It is writable.
- 'dig axfr ...' is not that helpful here.
