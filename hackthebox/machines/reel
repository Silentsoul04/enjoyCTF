(TODO, too hard for me now, client phising + too much powershell)
Hint:
- file hidden info => exiftool
- he talks about rtf, google

New Tools:
- CVE-2017-0199: https://github.com/bhdresh/CVE-2017-0199.git
    - generate malicious RTF files
- pwsh (little bug, don't do it in interactive)
- sendemail
- nishang/Client/Out-HTA.ps1
- BloodHound (Reveal relationships within an Active Directory env)
- PowerSploit-dev (dev branch!)

Details:
- ttl in ping, 127 => maybe windows, 64 => maybe linux
- ftp: mget * => download all
- cannot store file. Use 'nishang/Client/Out-HTA.ps1 -PayloadURL ps-shell.ps1' to execute in memory
- nginx upload
- google "powershell decrypt secure string" => get tom user and can ssh
    - or $cred.GetNetworkCredential() | fl
