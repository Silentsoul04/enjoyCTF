/Users directories has access denied.
using the TempUser and welcome2019 => find another txt "New Text Document.txt".
but it is empty.

tried to manipulate the password with 2020, 2018 and use crackmapexec
=> but it turns out smith, l.frost, frost and ... are all valid with welcome<any year>
=> but no use.

Use smb recursive download =>

find some user name in IT/Configs/Atlas/Temp.xml
find history items in IT/Configs/NotepadPlusPlus
<History nbMaxFile="15" inSubMenu="no" customLength="-1">       
<File filename="C:\windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" />   
<File filename="\\HTB-NEST\Secure$\IT\Carl\Temp.txt" />     
<File filename="C:\Users\C.Smith\Desktop\todo.txt" /> 

THe IT/Configs/RU_Scanner/RU_config.xml:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ConfigFile xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
<Port>389</Port>
<Username>c.smith</Username>
<Password>fTEzAfYDoz1YzkqhQkH6GQFYKp1XY5hm7bjOP86yYxE=</Password>
</ConfigFile>

No other files can be downloaded via smb.

decrypt by base64 =>
}13=XJBAX*Wcf?Î²c

but this maybe because some chars are not displayable.
tried online decrypter, there is some char not printable

## 4386 + smb
nc => HQK Reporting Service V1.2

google, didn't find exact match. But some how it keeps suggesting me to use some exploit related to MSSQL.
Look at the box created date and the exploit date. Maybe it is what I need.
=> nop, this is totally irrelevant.

using telnet instead of nc, can interact with it.

help -> know my functions
runquery 1 -> failed somehow.
setdir c:/, then LIST, => we can list remote file system
but we may use it to read some database file it can recognize.

after some trial and errors, it turns out it can say access denied but if we know the exact path to a file, we can still get in.
tested, so as the smbclient.

based on the nodepad++'s history=>
find C:\Shares\Secure\IT\Carl\VB projects\WIP\RU, there is our RU scanner.
smb secure$/IT/Carl/, find ip.txt mmc.txt

just read the code of Ru scanner. Find the decrypt func. find an online VB compiler and run it with the password we find
decrypted password =>
xRxRxPANCAK3SxRxRx
tried with service on port 4386. no dice.

smb to c.smith => get user.txt

keep reading c.smith's files, there is a empty "Debug Mode Password.txt"
find "HQK Reporting" folder and its config file, it is the service we are talking with on port 4386.
HQK Reporting/AD Integration Module/HqkLdap.exe
this hqkldap.exe seems to have nothing to do with the RU scanner.

## What we know
nodepad++ history => carl => there is a RU scanner => decrypted c.smith's pass.
smb with c.smith =>
- there is HQK reporting service
- it has a module HqkLdap.exe. 
- The "Debug Mode Password.txt" is empty.

strange thing is that:
- ru_scanner's config says its port is 389. But that port is for Ldap. So maybe HqkLdap.exe is running.

the ru_scanner source code gives nothing. I think the HqkLdap.exe is running on UDP 389.

get hint from forum, NTFS alternative data stream, again!
smb, allinfo, get "xxx:Password:$DATA", get the password
=> WBQ201953D8w

then use it as the debug password, we can run showquery to view data.

find this under C:/Program Files/HQK/LDAP/Ldap.conf
Domain=nest.local
Port=389
BaseOu=OU=WBQ Users,OU=Production,DC=nest,DC=local
User=Administrator
Password=yyEq0Uvvhq2uQOcWG8peLoeRQehqip/fKdeG/kjEVb4=

Use dnSpy to reverse HqkLdap.exe, just prepare the files the project needs, debug and read the password
=>
"XtH4nkS4Pl4y1nGX"

=> root!
