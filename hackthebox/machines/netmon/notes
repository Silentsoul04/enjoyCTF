### Enum
nmap vuln scan gives "Litespeed Web Server Source Code Disclosure (CVE-2010-2333)", not sure how to use it.
PRTG/18.1.37.13946
Indy httpd 18.1.37.13946

find https://github.com/M4LV0/PRTG-Network-Monitor-RCE, but needs authentication.
tried default cred prtgadmin:prtgadmin, doesn't work.
try to find cred from ftp
find this link https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/463-how-and-where-does-prtg-store-its-data => there should be a "PRTG configuration.dat"
(REMEMBER TO USE `ls -al` insteand of `ls` in ftp!!!!!)
found it, search prtgadmin, find encrypted hash, john doesn't recognize it.
find the "old.bak" version of the config, find:

<dbpassword>
<!-- User: prtgadmin -->
PrTg@dmin2018
</dbpassword>

sadly, cannot login.
(Think like a user!!!!! It ends with 2018, try 2019 or 2020!!!)

change it to 2019 to get in.

### Getting Foothold
use the https://github.com/M4LV0/PRTG-Network-Monitor-RCE =>
[*] exploit completed new user 'pentest' with password 'P3nT3st!' created have fun!
(Or we can do it manually by creating our own setup->account->notification)

/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbexec.py pentest:'P3nT3st!'@10.10.10.152
=> root shell
