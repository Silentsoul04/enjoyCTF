(love this one, and Mr. Robot)
Points:
- dirbuster + url we see => whiterose.txt
    - alternative: look at the cookies
- php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=xxx
    - no '.php', you godda try
- there is hint in the source code => "or is it?"
- be aware that the code will add ".php" to it.
- remember to try the url encoding
- thunderbird => copy it and edit host's thunderbird profile => read emails
    - also use our old friend firefox_decrypt => get password
- ssh via ipv6

New Tools:
- radare2

Details:
- very interesting to know that ipv6 may open 22 by looking at the size of /etc/iptables/rules.v4 and ..v6 and guessing.
- when scp via ipv6, use the ssh -6 dom@[<ipv6>]:<target file path> .
- this time it is a .so file, so we cannot run it directly. That's why we need reverse engineering
