Hazard:
 Hi, I've been experiencing problems with my cisco router. Here's a part of the configuration the previous admin had been using. I'm new to this and don't know how to fix it. :( 

Support Admin:
 Hi, thanks for posting the issue here. We provide fast support and help. Let me take a look and get back to you! 
 
Hazard:
 Thanks a lot. Also, please create an account for me on the windows server as I need to access the files. 

The attachment is downloaded config.txt. Google the cisco router config.
find this https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3850/software/release/3-2_0_se/system_management/configuration_guide/b_sm_32se_3850_cg_chapter_01001.html

brute force the secret by creating a txt file with "test:$1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91"
=>stealth1agent

with this cred, call psexec
/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/psexec.py hazard:stealth1agent@10.10.10.149
=> error is "share is not writable". Not LOGON failure. So the cred is right.

using smbmap, listed a lot of files under '.'. What is this? => just udner IPC$
use smbmap download them all, => their size are all 0.
tried with rout3r and admin cred, nothing.

(get hint here => we have cisco config with encrypted password, google decrypter.)

Decrypted password: $uperP@ssword
Decrypted password: Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d

can we login the webpage with password "stealth1agent" => Noo

use lookupsid.py to enum security identifiers in the domain.

used a tool called evil-winrm, get the foothold

tried to use found passwords to run as hazard, failed.
PowerUp.ps1 => nothing

found mozilla profiles, but cannot copy because another process is using it.
use firefox_decrypt 0.7.0 python2 version. Follow the https://www.andreafortuna.org/2017/12/27/how-to-cross-compile-a-python-script-into-a-windows-executable-on-linux/ to compile it to exe.
But the firefox_decrypt.py complains some files are missing. Tried thousands ways, failed.

(Get hint)
although we cannot list files in wwwroot, but we can read the file content by calling it name: issues.php, login.php
=> no use here, but good lesson

procdump64.exe => find admin@support.htb password => it is administartor's password.
