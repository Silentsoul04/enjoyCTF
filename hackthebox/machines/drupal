Points:
- droopescan
- burp to see why it doesn't work and make a guess or brute-force it.
- meterpreter and migrate or enum windows exploits by ps1 scripts.

Remember to google "xxxscan" for well known software.
Find version of the target software and google its exploit. If version matches but it doesn't work, it means you need a close look, via burp, to find out why.
Do not blindly try everything.
