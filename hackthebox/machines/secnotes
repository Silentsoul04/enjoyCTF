(love this box, classic user name exploit)
Lessons Learnt:
- user name is controlled by us.
- mount -t cifs -o username=tyler,password='92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&',uid=0,gid=0 //target_ip/target_dir /mnt/mydir
    - note it is better to be <target ip> not hostname
- alternative: send link to tyler change his password.
