Points:
- smb => find group file policy file Groups.xml (this file is before 2012)
- gpp-decrypt => find user&pass
- GetADUsers.py => user has access to AD
- GetUserSPNS.py => get admin's password hash
- Hashcat is fine but I used john the ripper because hashcat doesn't work in my VM and would ruin my host.
=> get admin password
- psexec.py to get shell as admin

New Tools:
- smbmap
- gpp-decrypt (decrypt password in group.xml)
- impacket
    - GetADUsers.py
    - GetUserSPNS.py
    - psexec.py
- BloodHoundAD (optional, to show Administrator can be logged in through kerberos)

Details:
- since there are smb port opening, i should first try nmap smb scripts. although it doest work here, the methodology is important.
- kerberos may complain the time skew problem. use ntpdate to fix it. REMEMBER to remove the 'time sync' property of the VM setting.
- love this box, learnt a lot about smb
