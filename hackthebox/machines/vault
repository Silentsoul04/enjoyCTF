(love this box, ssh tunneling and ovpn config attack. TODO: do it again. So hard)
Hints:
- foothold is easy
- ifconfig shows there are many VMs => upload nmap for further test
- ssh tunnel.
- after get in the DNS server, find what is Vault's IP
- nmap can fake its sending port
- gpg --list-keys

Details:
- ssh tunnel, when sshed in dave, keep pressing shift and then `c to create ~C, then we have an ssh command prompt
    - ssh> -L 8001:192.168.122.4:80 (or)
    - ssh> -D 1080
- burp to use proxy
    - user options -> socks proxy
- if it hangs, revert the machine

TODO: 
- learn socat used in ippsec's video
- learn the last mentioned VNC + reboot attack

tried using them in host header, no dice

tried /sparklays/ => 403 forbidden

gobuster on / and /sparklays/
gobuster -u http://vault.htb/sparklays/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,html

/ => nothing

/sparklays/
./login.php => access denied
./admin.php => login page
./design => /design/ => 403

gobuster on /sparklays/design/
./design.html => can upload
./uploads => 403 forbidden

assume the user is sparklays
brute-force the password by wfuzz => no dice
sqlmap => no dice

gobuster on /sparklays/design/uploads/ => nothing

try to upload php file by /sparklays/design/design.html => rejected
rename to shell.jpg => upload successfully, but cannot open
shell.jpg.php, php4 => reject
php5 => success! => rev shell

# priv esc - root
(ippsec's video)
web app => ovpn code execution => DNS server

DNS server finds dave:dav3gerous567

find ip of vault, scan but --source-port 53 because we are DNS, 53 is allowed by firewall => 987 is open => nc -p 53 (because 53 is not blocked by firewall) => find vault has ssh on 987

ncat -l 7001 --sh-exec "ncat 192.168.5.2 987 -p 53" &
ssh -p 7001 dave@localhost
(so that we can ssh from 53 port to outside)

need gpg key find it on DNS server
gpg --list-keys

use scp on IPv6 to copy files
to get ipv6 of neighbors: ping6 -I ens3 ff02::1
