(love this box, hard for me)
(Many path to attack this. See ippsec's video. Here only record one way.)
Hint:
- fuzz a lot, gobuster and host header
- change PHPSESSID to see what happens

Details:
- find documentation dir, fuzz .pdf,.txt
- guest:guest

logs:
# init
22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 7.4p1 Debian 10+deb9u3 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.25
443/tcp open  ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.25

redirected to https://intra.redcross.htb/   
add it into /etc/hosts

# 80
/ redirect to https://intra.redcross.htb/?page=login
gobuster => wildcard response => https

# 443
(from ippsec)
https certs => user name penelope

/ => redirect to https://intra.redcross.htb/?page=login
brute force it, interesting results =>
/init.php
/pages/:
./contact.php
./login.php
./actions.php
./header.php
./bottom.php
./app.php

contact.php, tried to apply php code, => filtered . Maybe it is because of some content filtering?
(but XSS in phone number input is ok. it is an alternative)

sqlmap => failed 

guess the password, guest:guest => get in
the param o can be sqli. => 
tables: messages, requests, users
for table users, it has columns: id, username, password, mail, role
=>
admin:$2y$10$z/d5GiwZuFqjY1jRiKIPzuPXKt0SthLOyU438ajqRBtrb7ZADpwq.
penelope:$2y$10$tY9Y955kyFB37GnW4xrC0.J.FzmkrQhxD..vKCQICvwOEgwfxqgAS
charles:$2y$10$bj5Qh0AbUM5wHeu/lTfjg.xPxjRQkqU6T8cs683Eus/Y89GHs.G7i
tricia:$2y$10$Dnv/b2ZBca2O4cp0fsBbjeQ/0HnhvJ7WrC/ZN3K7QKqTa9SSKP6r.

hashcat => charles:cookiemonster

gobuster finds ../documentation/account-signup.pdf => find guest:guest

replace the PHPSESSID with the one found in infra.redcross.htb in admin.redcross.htb to get in

## admin.redcross.htb
create user => zhe0ops : odQ1T071
ssh ok. But restricted
find iptctl.c

firewall rules page =>
allow our ip, re-nmap
find command injection point => rev shell

(optional)use haraka 2.8.8 exploit => get penelope

# priv esc
init.php =>
$dbuser='dbcross';
$dbpass='LOSPxnme4f5pH5wp';

firewall.php =>
user=www password=aaXwrtUO9_aa&"

user.php =>
dbname=unix user=unixnss password=fios@ew023xnw

actions.php =>
dbname=unix user=unixusrmgr password=dheu%7wjx8B&

psql => 
tricia   | $1$WFsH/kvS$5gAjMYSvbpZFNu//uMPmp. => useless
create a new user by INSERT with /bin/bash and ssh login

# root 1
one way to root => read the psql conf and get the powerful user:pass and can add powerful user.

# root 2
cat /etc/group => find sudo group => create a new user with gid
ssh => sudo => root

# root 3
the binary iptctl has no ALSR itself. (lib does have) => rop chain
use plt entry address, which is fixed
objdump -D -j .plt iptctl | grep @plt
note functions use rdi(first arg) and rsi(second) as input, so we need pop rdi and pop rsi
r2 => /R pop rsi
(cat /tmp/out.txt ; cat) | ./iptctl -i => to run and make it stay alive
