Points:
- only cookies we can change. Use cookie manager to change and see what's going on => google "nodejs unserialize exploit" => write a script to help to generate strings => get user
- find output.txt is generated by root => which process did that? => try 'ps -auxww', no dice => check /va/log/syslog => find the script => easy

Details:
- classic nodejs unserialize exploit
- 'tail -1000 /var/log/syslog' => find last 1000 log
