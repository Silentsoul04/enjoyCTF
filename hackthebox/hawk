(todo, sadly it was removed from active boxes list this Sunday)
Points:
- ftp anonymous => encrypted file => base64 -d => bruteforce-salted-openssl
- enable module which enables php code.
- find database username and password => also is the user pass for ssh
- ssh forward the local port to target's local H2 port.
- the sql exec doesn't accept some characters. Write shell into script file and execute that script.

New Tools:
- rsg (https://github.com/mthbernardes/rsg/blob/master/shells.txt) 

Details:
- find this: https://dilsec.com/2017/03/27/ew_skuzzy-1-ctf-walktrough/, but kali can install bruteforce-salted-openssl directly.
- to determine which is the cipher used in openssl encryption, write a bash script to brute-forcely try them and find the ones with same length of the encryption text.
- export TERM=xterm => so we can clear screen in reversed shell cmd
- ssh tunnel is very nice in this video. He shows both the local and reverse ssh tunneling. The reverse tunneling is "i have a service, but I want tunnel it to remove server's local port". The local tunneling is "I don't have a service, but I want to tunnel other box's service to my local port".
