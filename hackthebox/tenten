(CTF-like)
Points:
- brute force the web page manually, replace the digit => find interesting name
- wpscan => user name and vulnerable plugin => search for the file
- some idot may upload a picture as their resume
- steghide => find hidden files
- read the id_rsa file => "Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED" => it is encrypted
- ssh2john id_rsa > enc; john enc rockyou.txt => get plain private key file
- priv esc is really simple

Learnt:
steghide, ssh2john
