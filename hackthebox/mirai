Points:
- association, deduction
- default credential
- 'strings /dev/sdb' to read the device directly

Details:
- /etc/hosts => blocked => view source code => find 'pi.hole' domain => use Rasp-Pi default credential to ssh (very hard to see this)
- the testdisk and photorec failed.
- other ports are rabbit holes.
