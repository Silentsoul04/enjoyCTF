(love this box! But so hard!)
Hints:
- RTFSC
- webdav <=> upload?
- farewal => normal shell dies
- password reused by a user, not root
- use init.d to know how service is started
- crontab => APT update => apt update pre-invoke attack

Details:
- files under /etc/apache2/ are interesting. such as 'sites-enabled'.
- could use ippsec's http rev shell script
- roxychains nmap -sT 127.0.0.1 -p 22 -n
    - not the 10.10.10.67, maybe because of firewall
    - because we only have http proxy, use 'nmap -sT' (but proxychain + nmap doesn't work in this box)
- APT attack:
    - APT::Update::Pre-Invoke {"/bin/bash /tmp/zhe0ops.sh"}
    - put it to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
